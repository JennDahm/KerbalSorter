# KerbalSorter 0.3
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows players to sort their crew rosters.

This mod adds a small toolbar to every crew roster in the game outside of flight mode for sorting your kerbals! Currently supported sorting criterion are:

* Name
* Class
* Level
* Gender

If you have lots of kerbals, or are simply very organized, this is the mod for you!

## Future Plans

* Add filtering.


## To-Do

* Add sorting assigned and KIA crew in the Astronaut Complex
* Add sorting by number of flights
* Add fly-in animation to editor sort bar to match the Crew tab fly-in animation.
* Re-sort lists when they change.
* Perhaps find a way to restore original order when sorting options are cancelled.

Three icons used in this mod (the wrench, steering wheel, and vial, as used in the sorting-by-class button) were taken from game-icons.net, and are licensed by them under the Creative Commons 3.0 License. I did not modify them in any way, except to display them on buttons in the game. All other icons were made by me (Jon Dahm) and are public domain.
