# KerbalSorter 0.1.1
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows players to sort their crew rosters.

This mod is currently nothing but a proof-of-concept. It will sort the list of available crew in the Astronaut Complex by name and then profession. It has some bugs, but nothing game-breaking as far as I know.

To-Do:

* Add buttons for sorting
* Look into sorting the lists in the editors and launch menus.

No Known Bugs at the moment.
