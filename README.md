# KerbalSorter 0.4 (In Progress)
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows players to sort their crew rosters.

This mod adds a small toolbar to every crew roster in the game outside of flight mode for sorting your kerbals! Currently supported sorting criterion are:

* Name
* Class
* Level
* Gender

If you have lots of kerbals, or are simply very organized, this is the mod for you!

## Future Plans

* Add filtering.


## To-Do

* Add sorting by number of flights.
* Re-sort Editor list when it changes.
* Determine original order for assigned kerbals.
* Add tooltips.


## Bugs

These are the known bugs at the moment. Please file an issue if you find another one!
* In the Editor, when removing a kerbal from a vehicle's crew roster, the kerbal is not sorted back into the available list; instead they're just put at the top.
* In the Launch Window, when dragging and dropping a kerbal into the list of available crew, the kerbal is not sorted back into the available list. I seem to have no way to detect when this is done, nor any way to disable it.

Three icons used in this mod (the wrench, steering wheel, and vial, as used in the sorting-by-class button) were taken from game-icons.net, and are licensed by them under the Creative Commons 3.0 License. I did not modify them in any way, except to display them on buttons in the game. All other icons were made by me (Jon Dahm) and are public domain.
