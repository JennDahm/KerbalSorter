# KerbalSorter 0.1
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that allows players to sort their crew rosters.

This mod is currently nothing but a proof-of-concept. It will sort the list of available crew in the Astronaut Complex by name and then profession. It has some bugs, but nothing game-breaking as far as I know.

To-Do:

* Add buttons for sorting
* Fix bugs
* Look into sorting the lists in the editors and launch menus.

Known Bugs:

* After changing scenes from the Space Centre (i.e. entering an editor or the Tracking Station), you can only enter the Astronaut Complex once; after leaving, it won't let you re-enter. Switching scenes from the Space Centre allows you to enter the Astronaut Complex again.
* When entering the Astronaut Complex directly from an editor, the sorter is not called.
